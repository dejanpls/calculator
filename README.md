# Calculator

## A Project from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator">TOP Fundamentals Course</a>

### Details

This fundamentals final project is going to combine everything Iâ€™ve learned so far: 

* Make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* Enable keyboard as well as button click `input`.
* Division by zero shows a funny error message.


**Note** 
*I've spent a lot of time solving this, probably more than many some would need to build a space rocket, but i've done my best.*
