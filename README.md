# Calculator

## A Project from <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator">TOP Fundamentals Course</a>

### Details

This <a href="https://dejanpls.github.io/calculator/">fundamentals final project</a> is going to combine everything Iâ€™ve learned so far: 

* Make an on-screen calculator using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
* Enable keyboard as well as button click input into display area (`input`).
* Division by zero shows a funny error message.


**Note** 
*I've spent a lot of time solving this, but i've done my best.*
*There's still a lot of space for improvements.*
*I haven't been able to figure out a way to combine key and mouse events*
*into single functions.*
